When\n//   `getAttrs` is provided, it takes precedence.\n//\n//   getAttrs:: ?(union<dom.Node, string>) → ?union<Object, false>\n//   A function used to compute the attributes for the node or mark\n//   created by this rule. Can also be used to describe further\n//   conditions the DOM element or style must match. When it returns\n//   `false`, the rule won't match. When it returns null or undefined,\n//   that is interpreted as an empty/default set of attributes.\n//\n//   Called with a DOM Element for `tag` rules, and with a string (the\n//   style's value) for `style` rules.\n//\n//   contentElement:: ?union<string, (dom.Node) → dom.Node>\n//   For `tag` rules that produce non-leaf nodes or marks, by default\n//   the content of the DOM element is parsed as content of the mark\n//   or node. If the child nodes are in a descendent node, this may be\n//   a CSS selector string that the parser must use to find the actual\n//   content element, or a function that returns the actual content\n//   element to the parser.\n//\n//   getContent:: ?(dom.Node, schema: Schema) → Fragment\n//   Can be used to override the content of a matched node.

Such functions will be called before any handling\n//   ProseMirror does of events fired on the editable DOM element.\n//   Contrary to the other event handling props, when returning true\n//   from such a function, you are responsible for calling\n//   `preventDefault` yourself (or not, if you want to allow the\n//   default behavior).\n//\n//   handleKeyDown:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor receives a `keydown` event.\n//\n//   handleKeyPress:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Handler for `keypress` events.\n//\n//   handleTextInput:: ?(view: EditorView, from: number, to: number, text: string) → bool\n//   Whenever the user directly input text, this handler is called\n//   before the input is applied.

The\n//   `direct` flag will be true for the inner node.\n//\n//   handleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is clicked, after `handleClickOn` handlers\n//   have been called.\n//\n//   handleDoubleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a double click.\n//\n//   handleDoubleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is double-clicked, after `handleDoubleClickOn`.\n//\n//   handleTripleClickOn:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, node: Node, nodePos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent, direct: bool) → bool\n//   Called for each node around a triple click.\n//\n//   handleTripleClick:: ?(view: EditorView, pos: number, event: dom.MouseEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor is triple-clicked, after `handleTripleClickOn`.\n//\n//   handlePaste:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.ClipboardEvent, slice: Slice) → bool\n//   Can be used to override the behavior of pasting. `slice` is the\n//   pasted content parsed by the editor, but you can directly access\n//   the event to get at the raw content.\n//\n//   handleDrop:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.Event, slice: Slice, moved: bool) → bool\n//   Called when something is dropped on the editor. `moved` will be\n//   true if this drop moves from the current selection (which should\n//   thus be deleted).\n//\n//   handleScrollToSelection:: ?(view: EditorView) → bool\n//   Called when the view, after updating its state, tries to scroll\n//   the selection into view. A handler function may return false to\n//   indicate that it did not handle the scrolling and further\n//   handlers or the default behavior should be tried.\n//\n//   createSelectionBetween:: ?(view: EditorView, anchor: ResolvedPos, head: ResolvedPos) → ?Selection\n//   Can be used to override the way a selection is created when\n//   reading a DOM selection between the given anchor and head.\n//\n//   domParser:: ?DOMParser\n//   The [parser](#model.DOMParser) to use when reading editor changes\n//   from the DOM.

The `plain` flag will be true when\n//   the text is pasted as plain text.\n//\n//   clipboardTextParser:: ?(text: string, $context: ResolvedPos, plain: bool) → Slice\n//   A function to parse text from the clipboard into a document\n//   slice.

Should map node and mark names to constructor\n//   functions that produce a [`NodeView`](#view.NodeView) object\n//   implementing the node's display behavior. For nodes, the third\n//   argument `getPos` is a function that can be called to get the\n//   node's current position, which can be useful when creating\n//   transactions to update it. For marks, the third argument is a\n//   boolean that indicates whether the mark's content is inline.\n//\n//   `decorations` is an array of node or inline decorations that are\n//   active around the node. They are automatically drawn in the\n//   normal way, and you will usually just want to ignore this, but\n//   they can also be used as a way to provide context information to\n//   the node view without adding it to the document itself.\n//\n//   clipboardSerializer:: ?DOMSerializer\n//   The DOM serializer to use when putting content onto the\n//   clipboard. If not given, the result of\n//   [`DOMSerializer.fromSchema`](#model.DOMSerializer^fromSchema)\n//   will be used.\n//\n//   clipboardTextSerializer:: ?(Slice) → string\n//   A function that will be called to get the text for the current\n//   selection when copying text to the clipboard. By default, the\n//   editor will use [`textBetween`](#model.Node.textBetween) on the\n//   selected range.\n//\n//   decorations:: ?(state: EditorState) → ?DecorationSet\n//   A set of [document decorations](#view.Decoration) to show in the\n//   view.\n//\n//   editable:: ?(state: EditorState) → bool\n//   When this returns false, the content of the view is not directly\n//   editable.\n//\n//   attributes:: ?union<Object<string>, (EditorState) → ?Object<string>>\n//   Control the DOM attributes of the editable element. May be either\n//   an object or a function going from an editor state to an object.\n//   By default, the element will get a class `\"ProseMirror\"`, and\n//   will have its `contentEditable` attribute determined by the\n//   [`editable` prop](#view.EditorProps.editable). Additional classes\n//   provided here will be added to the class. For other attributes,\n//   the value provided first (as in\n//   [`someProp`](#view.EditorView.someProp)) will be used.\n//\n//   scrollThreshold:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the distance (in pixels) between the cursor and the\n//   end of the visible viewport at which point, when scrolling the\n//   cursor into view, scrolling takes place. Defaults to 0.\n//\n//   scrollMargin:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the extra space (in pixels) that is left above or\n//   below the cursor when it is scrolled into view. Defaults to 5.\n\n// DirectEditorProps:: interface extends EditorProps\n//\n// The props object given directly to the editor view supports two\n// fields that can't be used in plugins:\n//\n//   state:: EditorState\n//   The current state of the editor.\n//\n//   dispatchTransaction:: ?(tr: Transaction)\n//   The callback over which to send transactions (state updates)\n//   produced by the view.
